## About Me

I am an ambitious Masterâ€™s graduate in Oncology from Southern Medical University, advised by Prof. Xia Guo. I also worked as an AI Medical Consultant at an AI company in Shanghai, where I analyzed complex medical data with AI and developed/optimized AI medical models. Specializing in tumor epigenetics, immunotherapy resistance (especially CD8+ TILs activation, metabolism, and senescence), glucose metabolism, and cell programmed death, I have published 4 high-impact publications (Cancer Lett, Adv Sci, J Colloid Interface Sci, etc.), 1 patent, 2 articles to receive with minor reversions completed (ACS central science, Cell death & disease), and 3 additional manuscripts currently in review-reflecting my robust track record in translating mechanistic research into therapeutic insights. Proficient in wet lab techniques and bioinformatics (High-throughput sequencing, TCGA analysis, etc.), I aim to pursue a PhD to deepen my exploration of cancer mechanisms-driven by the mission to translate scientific insights into tangible breakthroughs for cancer eradication!

## Research Interests

- **Research areas**: Tumor malignant transformation, ICIs resistance mechanisms, CD8+ TILs function and senescence study, epigenetics, PROTACs system, glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, cuproptosis regulation, exosome mechanisms, high-throughput sequencing analysis, AI-driven bioinformatics, translational research, etc.
- **Skills**: Scientific writing and publishing, molecular biology Experiment (wb, q-PCR, dot-blot, pull-down, ICP-MS, etc.), mice Experiment (subcutaneous injection, intraperitoneal injection, sugery, in vivo imaging, pet-CT, etc.), immunology experiment (FC, Elisa, IHC, T cell isolation and co-culture), senescent Experiment, human organoid culture, seahorse, High-throughput sequencing (scRNA-seq, acRIP-seq, proteomics-seq, targeted metabolomics-seq, etc.), machine learning for bioinformatics (R Language Data Analysis for SVM, Lasso algorithm, etc.), AI, PS, etc.
